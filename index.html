    </p>

    <p class="text">
      The Royal Guard and our Holy King will infiltrate
      <br>the Emperor's Stronghold and abolish him.
      <br>The Stronghold is build to withstand vigorous attacks
      <br>and the Emporer will be well guarded by his loyal Dragonlings.
      <br>Either by brute force or insightfull wisdom
      <br>you must get to the sinful Emperor; whatever the cost!
