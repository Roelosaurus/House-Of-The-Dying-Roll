    <p class="intro">
        THE EMPEROR MUST DIE.<br>
        <br>
        THE ROYAL GUARD HAS BEEN DEPLOYED<br>
        AND THE TRUE KING SHALL SIT UPON THE THRONE.<br>
        <br>
        EXECUTE OUR DIVINE KING'S COMMANDMENT:<br>
        END THE CORRUPT EMPEROR<br>
        AND BRING FREEDOM TO THE PEOPLE.
    </p>


    <p class="title">
        Royal Guard's Assignment<br>
    </p>

    <p class="text">
        The Royal Guard and our Holy King will infiltrate<br>
        the Emperor's Stronghold and abolish him.<br>
        The Stronghold is build to withstand vigorous attacks<br>
        and the Emporer will be well guarded by his loyal Dragonlings.<br>
        Either by brute force or insightfull wisdom<br>
        you must get to the sinful Emperor; whatever the cost!<br>
